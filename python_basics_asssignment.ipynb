        "-   Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simple, readable syntax, which makes it popular for web development, data science, AI, and task automation\n",
        "\n",
        "2 What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "- A Python Interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code. It translates your Python instructions into machine-readable form line\n",
        "\n",
        "3  What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "- True, False, None\tand, or, not, is, in\tif, else, elif, for, while, break, continue, pass, try, except, finally, raise, assert\n",
        "\n",
        "4  Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "-  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names\n",
        "\n",
        "5  What is mutability in Python\n",
        "- These objects can be modified in place after their creation. This means you can change their content or structure without creating a new object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6 Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "- Lists are mutable (changeable) by design and implement methods for adding, removing, and changing elements, while tuples are immutable because their implementation intentionally lacks these mutator operations\n",
        "\n",
        "7  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "- == (Equality Operator): This operator checks for value equality. It determines if the values of two objects are the same. This can be customized by defining the __eq__ method within a class.\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "is (Identity Operator): This operator checks for object identity. It determines if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory. It essentially compares the memory addresses of the objects. The id() function can be used to retrieve the memory address of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "8  What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "- python utilizes three primary logical operators: and, or, and not\n",
        "\n",
        "9  What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type casting, also known as type conversion, in Python refers to the process of converting a value or variable from one data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10 What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "- Implicit type casting is an automatic conversion of one data type to another by the compiler, while explicit type casting is a manual conversion performed by the programmer using a specific cast operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "11 What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "- Conditional statements in Python, such as if, elif (else if), and else, serve the fundamental purpose of controlling the flow of a program based on whether certain conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "12  How does the elif statement work\n",
        "- The elif statement, short for \"else if,\" is a conditional statement used in programming languages like Python to check for multiple conditions sequentially. It functions as part of an if-elif-else chain, allowing a program to execute different blocks of code based on which condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "13 What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "- The main difference is that a for loop is best for a predetermined number of iterations, while a while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition that changes during the loop's execution. A for loop is often more concise for definite loops (like iterating over a list), whereas a while loop is more flexible for indefinite loops (like waiting for a file to be ready).\n",
        "\n",
        "14 Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in scenarios where the number of iterations is not known in advance and the loop's termination depends on a specific condition being met, rather than iterating over a fixed sequence or a predetermined range.\n",
